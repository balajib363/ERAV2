## ðŸ“– Introduction

The goal of this assignment is to implement and evaluate the performance of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with different normalization techniques on the CIFAR10 dataset. The network has a specific architecture (C1 C2 c3 P1 C3 C4 C5 c6 P2 C7 C8 C9 GAP c10 ) with the total parameter count kept under 50,000. "C" means 3x3 convoluion, "c" means 1x1 convolution, "P" means max pooling and "GAP" means global avaerag pooling. Network with skip connections.

Three versions of the network are created, each applying a different normalization technique: Group Normalization (GN), Layer Normalization (LN), and Batch Normalization (BN). Each model is trained for 20 epochs, and the goal is to achieve an accuracy of above 70% for each model.

The CIFAR10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color training images and 10,000 test images, labeled into 10 classes. The 10 classes represent airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 validation images.


## ðŸ““ Notebook and Results

Below is a table summarizing the performance of each model. It provides links to the notebooks for each model, along with their respective training and test accuracies.

| Model | Notebook Link | Training Accuracy | Test Accuracy |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Batch Normalization | [BN Notebook](./ERA2S8F_BN.ipynb) | 71.82 % | 73.24 % |
| Group Normalization | [GN Notebook](./ERA2S8F_GN.ipynb) | 69.19 % | 70.24 % |
| Layer Normalization | [LN Notebook](./ERA2S8F_LN.ipynb) | 50.37 % | 52.64 % |
