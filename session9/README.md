## Problem Statement

1. Write a new network that   
    1. has the architecture to C1C2C3C40 (No MaxPooling, but 3 convolutions, where the last one has a stride of 2 instead) (If you can figure out how to use Dilated kernels here instead of MP or strided convolution, then 200pts extra!)  
    2. total RF must be more than 44  
    3. one of the layers must use Depthwise Separable Convolution  
    4. one of the layers must use Dilated Convolution  
    5. use GAP (compulsory):- add FC after GAP to target #of classes (optional)  
    6. use albumentation library and apply:  
        1. horizontal flip  
        2. shiftScaleRotate  
        3. coarseDropout (max_holes = 1, max_height=16px, max_width=16, min_holes = 1, min_height=16px, min_width=16px, fill_value=(mean of your dataset), mask_fill_value = None)  
    7. achieve 85% accuracy, as many epochs as you want. Total Params to be less than 200k.  
    8. make sure you're following code-modularity (else 0 for full assignment) 
    9. upload to Github  
    10. Attempt S9-Assignment Solution.  
    11. Questions in the Assignment QnA are:  
        1. copy and paste your model code from your model.py file (full code) [125]  
        2. copy paste output of torch summary [125]  
        3. copy-paste the code where you implemented albumentation transformation for all three transformations [125]  
        4. copy paste your training log (you must be running validation/text after each Epoch [125]  
        5. Share the link for your README.md file. [200]  


## ðŸ“ˆ Results

The model was trained for 25 epochs and achieved an accuracy of 73.39% on the test set. The total number of parameters in the model was under 200k. 

Train accuracy: 65.03 %
Test accuracy: 73.39 %
